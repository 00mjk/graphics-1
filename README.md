Rust-Graphics
=============

A meta library for computer graphics, written in Rust, that works with multiple backends

Notice! This project is still on the drafting table!

## Motivation

There are relatively few graphics functions required to make pretty advanced games or applications. I would like to write a graphics API in pure Rust that can easily be adapted to multiple backends. This makes it possible to expand the meta library without having to hard code new features per application. There are certain limitations to pure libraries, but because it allows you to control the backend there is nothing that prevents you to hard code for special cases.
